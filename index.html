			<h1><b>What does it mean to be a member of society?</b></h1>

			To be a member of society means to realize how you view yourself vs. how society views you<br>
			How you view yourself: culture, education, race, background, religion<br>
			How does society view you: social class, sexual identity, ethnicity, race<br>
				<p>Being a member of society is being part of something greater than ourselves. Everyone wants belonging.<br>
				Society is the ultimate qualifier for being part of something or someplace where you might, at times, sacrifice certain rights or liberties to belong or contribute to the harmonious co-existence of that community or society. <br>
				Joining political parties, specific charitable organizations, and clubs is how people in the society want to belong in something more significant. Being a productive member of the community means giving up individual freedoms to guarantee our protection and protecting people we care about the most and things we care about.<br>
				Being a productive member of society means being an asset rather than a liability to those around us. As the word ubuntu can accurately convey what a member of being a community means, our humanity and existence without fear or constant threats are tied to othersâ€™ humanity and harmonious existence.
